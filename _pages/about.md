Veterinary medical scientist with interests in applying next generation sequencing approaches to advance animal and human health. Trained in the context of canine cancer immunology and single-cell RNA sequencing, but always looking to expand my knowledge base across technologies and species. 

My training in medicine and computational biology makes me uniquely positioned to apply bioinformatic approaches while keeping in mind the biological relevance of the analysis. I have applied my skill set across a variety of settings including canine peripheral blood, canine osteosarcoma, equine synovial fluid, canine duodenum, and more. I am passionate about transparent reporting of scientific findings and I complete all of my analysis using open source tools.
